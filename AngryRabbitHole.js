//Only an idea for the moment
//Will implement soon

//Base turns would be:
//-->base bet @ x2
//-->if win, restart

//if base turn is lost, bet a turn to get back the lost bits and make a bit of profit:
//-->last bet * 6 @ x1.25

//if the previous turn is lost, go down the rabbit hole:
//-->last bet * 60.5% @ x3

//Continue turns until safety is reached (safety is an input from the user, it's how deep we go down in the rabbit hole)
//if safety is reached, go back to base turns
